# ForgeMind

**AI-powered tools for mechanical design, validation, and manufacturing optimization.**

ForgeMind helps mechanical engineers design faster, validate earlier, and manufacture smarter. We combine deep CAD integrations with a standalone AI system so teams can work efficiently without being locked into any single CAD vendor.

## What is ForgeMind?

ForgeMind is an AI-driven mechanical design platform built for modern engineering teams. It provides:

- A **design co-pilot** embedded directly inside popular CAD tools
- A **CAD-independent system** for design validation, optimization, and manufacturing checks

This dual approach ensures ForgeMind remains useful even as CAD vendors evolve, restrict APIs, or ship their own AI features.

## Core Products

### 1. Design Co-Pilot (CAD-Integrated)

ForgeMind integrates directly into leading CAD software via custom add-ins, including:

- Fusion 360  
- CATIA  
- SolidWorks  
- (and more)

Inside CAD, ForgeMind acts as an AI co-pilot that:
- Assists with feature creation and modification
- Helps reason about assemblies and constraints
- Provides early feedback on tolerances, lightweighting, and manufacturability
- Reduces repetitive manual CAD work

Engineers stay in their existing workflow while gaining AI assistance where it matters.

### 2. ForgeMind Hub (CAD-Independent)

ForgeMind Hub is a standalone system that works **without any CAD integration**.

Users can:
- Upload existing CAD files (STEP, STL, etc.)
- Create or modify designs from text
- Run design validation, tolerance analysis, and lightweight modeling
- Perform manufacturing-oriented checks (e.g. composite readiness, AFP constraints)

This ensures ForgeMind continues to work even if CAD vendors limit API access or change their platforms.

## Why ForgeMind?

- **Not tied to one CAD vendor** – works with or without CAD integrations  
- **Manufacturing-first** – optimized for real-world production, not just geometry  
- **AI where it matters** – validation, constraints, and decision support, not just text-to-CAD  
- **Built for modern teams** – startups, suppliers, and advanced manufacturing groups  

---

## Use Cases

- Mechanical design acceleration
- Assembly and tolerance validation
- Lightweighting and cost optimization
- Composite and AFP-oriented design validation
- Early manufacturability feedback
- CAD-agnostic design review and analysis

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** Web and desktop interfaces for standalone design and validation
- **CAD Add-ins:** Native integrations for in-CAD co-pilot workflows
- **Backend:** AI services for geometry reasoning, validation, and optimization
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud-based, scalable, and vendor-agnostic

---

## Status

ForgeMind is actively under development and transitioning from prototype to early beta.  
We are working closely with mechanical engineers to validate real-world workflows and manufacturing constraints.

---

## Vision

Our goal is to become the **AI layer for mechanical engineering** — helping teams design better products, faster, while staying independent of any single CAD ecosystem.
